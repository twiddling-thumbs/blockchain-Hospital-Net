# blockchain-Hospital-Net
A decentralized web app for secure data transfer for hospitals

Built a decentralized application with meta-mask access authentication. The application would work with IPFS to store the ML models or any medical data, IPFS creates hashes of the images and the designed smart contract will store the hash on the blockchain, the user can retrieve their data through the hash from the blockchain. Retrieving the ML model one can securely implement their part of the research without worrying about the security concerns. The tools used were Solidity, Next.js, React.js, HTML/CSS, and IPFS.
